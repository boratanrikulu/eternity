### Usage of Posts

Eternity is configurable and you can change feature behaviours by setting variables.

Here's a basic post structure. You can basically use `tags` to set which pages will have this post. We suggest to use `work` for homepage and `archive` for all posts. (Note: you can change their names too).  
If you want to create a new page, just add it as a new tag.

```yaml
---
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
---
```

You can set `date` value for your posts. It will be used in Post page and for posts sorting. If you want, you can use `weight` value for sorting. (Note: if you won't set a `date`, we check `exif` value of the image to use in post.)

```yaml
---
weight: 9
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
- first
date: 2022-07-24
---
```

You can use multiple images by adding them to `images` array. Default view is `row`. But if you want to set them as `column`, you can use `multipleColumn` value. Both local images and remote images are supported. If you use remote image, it will be downloaded.


```yaml
---
weight: 9
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
- /images/my-image-2.jpg
multipleColumn: true
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
- first
date: 2022-07-24
---
```

When you use multiple images, first image will be used as thumbnail in posts page. If you want to use different image, you can use `mainImage` variable.

```yaml
---
weight: 9
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
- /images/my-image-2.jpg
mainImage: /images/different-image.jpg
multipleColumn: true
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
- first
date: 2022-07-24
---
```

If you want to hide exif value for a post, you can use `hideExif` variable. Also there's available `hidetitle` and `hideDate` variables. We used that variables in about page to be able to create a single page with using same layout.

```yaml
---
weight: 9
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
- /images/my-image-2.jpg
multipleColumn: true
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
- first
date: 2022-07-24
hideExif: true
---
```

You can use `title`, `subtitle`, `url` variables for the post.

```yaml
---
images:
- /images/about.png
title: About!!
subtitle: Here's who am I.
url: me
hideTitle: true
hideExif: true
hideDate: true
---
```

Markdown is fully supported.

```yaml
---
weight: 9
images:
- /images/my-image-1.jpg
- /images/my-image-2.jpg
multipleColumn: true
title: Here's my first post!!
tags:
- work
- first
date: 2022-07-24
---

## Markdown

You can use **Markdown** format to write **your story**.

### Subtitle

For landing page (_index.md), you can use `desc` array to set your description, under the enter button.
```yaml
---
desc:
- Eternity is a minimalist Hugo theme
- designed for portfolio sites with a fresh feel.

```

For landing page (_index.md), you can use `featuredTags` array to show some tags in Landing Page.
```yaml
featuredTags:
  - title: people
    image: https://source.unsplash.com/random?people&1649630128
    url: /tags/people/
  - title: nature
